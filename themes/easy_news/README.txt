Easy News is a responsive and lightweight theme, suitable for news publishing
websites. It is a subtheme based on Uikitty, which implements Uikit scripts and
styling. The key features are:

- Responsive grid layout for pages and nodes
- Custom teaser and full content view styles
- Dropdown menu, off-canvas for small and medium devices
- Two-column area in front page with up to six widget regions
- Responsive right sidebar, split into upper and lower regions
- Image optimization and responsive inline images
- Hover effect for buttons, badges and thumbnails
- Simple and easy to customize color scheme

Standard Drupal procedure for subthemes applies:

1. Download and install the latest release of Uikitty-8x-2.x
2. Download, install and set as default the Easy News theme

The project documentation discusses installation, demo setup and enriching the
theme with slideshow, social media and embedded video via contributed modules.
